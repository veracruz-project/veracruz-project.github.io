I was prepared to write a lengthy post here about how we ported Veracruz to run on the recently announced Nitro Enclaves for Graviton processors (which, if you're not a fanboy, are AARCH64 cores instead of Intel).

However, there's not much to write, because it just... worked.

One of the team members had already added the tooling support in our docker container, so when it came time to port to the newly supported
platform, we just needed to pull the code onto a newly created EC2 instance, build the docker file, and then run the tests. Everything just worked.

There was one tiny hitch when running the Linux platform on Graviton, but that wasn't required to run Nitro (remember, the linux support is just
a development vehicle that "pretends" to use PSA attestation). This involved a difference in the way the Rust tooling treats C char values for
x86_64 vs aarch64 (one treats them as `u8` and the other as `i8`, I can't remember which is which). This is all neither here nor there, as PSA attestation
is not required for Nitro enclaves.

All in all, we were very pleased with how easy the porting was, which was made truly simple by the work the team did ahead of time, of course.
